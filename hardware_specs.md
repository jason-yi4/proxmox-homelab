### Notes:
* The SSD is used to store the ProxmoxVE Hypervisor as well as the VMs running on the server.
* The Wi-Fi adapter is redundant and unnecessary for this project as I have the server directly connected to my router via ethernet. It is kept as a holdover from when this PC was just a secondary office desktop.
